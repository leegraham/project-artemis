# Project Artemis is an open source project where I hope we can pull together experts from various disciplines to develop a multi-layered security program to those in roles of power to better protect our generation's greatest gifts... our children!


## Why Artemis?
Artemis was the Greek Goddess of hunting, as well as protector of young children*. 


## What are the multi-facted problems we want to mitigate and/or solve?
1. Stopping mass murder in schools https://github.com/leegraham/project-artemis/issues/1
2. Suicide in children and teens

## Why a multi-layered security approach?
The problem we aim to help solve and provide guidance on are complex amd multi-facted. As is cybersecurity, the best approach is to have many layers of protection. In parallel, the biggest issue in security is the human component. 

Our desire to help use our variety of expertise and passion for protecting our children.
